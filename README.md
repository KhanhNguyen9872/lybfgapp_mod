## About Original Project
**lybxlpsv’s Frame Generation for Android**

### What’s this?
This technique creates interpolated frames to try to increase perceived motion smoothness, also known for providing up to ‘2x’ the FPS, although the actual increase may vary due to processing overhead and the screen resolution of your device.
